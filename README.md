# HERE REST API Demo

This iOS app allows for creating and editing itineraries. Itineraries consist of at least 2 locations that can be added through a search field. The location search uses the [Geocoder API](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/geocoder/topics/overview.html). After selecting at least 2 locations, the [Routing API](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/routing/topics/overview.html) is asked for a route to connect the waypoints. The routing mode can be switched between car and pedestrian. Waypoints can be deleted or re-ordered in the user interface. Addinionally, a visual map of a route, that is generated by the [Map Image API](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/enterprise-map-image/topics/overview.html), can be displayed. 

Itineraries will be stored on the iOS device.

The app runs on iPhone and iPad devices and supports portrait and landscape orientation.
